Dear Team, 

 I have used html ,css and js to achieve this task, in html used a div and few elements and css for styling in js I have used queryselector to get the html tags and used "keydown" eventlistner whenever any key is pressed from keyboard, the callback function will be called, and the current count and remaining count will be displayed, i have  used getattribute where in html I have given the maxlimit of the letters that needs to be entered  and subtracted from the maxlenght in js to track it.
